	abstract = {More than 2.5 million hectares have been impacted by coal mining in the Appalachian region of the United States. Revegetation to forested cover is a desirable post-mining land use but is often impractical given the challenges of reforestation on abandoned coal mines. Considering a prospective pollination crisis and the potential value of habitat restoration for pollinators, prairie restoration on mine lands offers a practical restoration option. We tested the effect of native prairie restoration in comparison to traditional reclamation with non-native cool-season grassland on pollinator richness, diversity, and community structure at three mined sites in southeastern Ohio. Rather than treatment level effects, we found correlations between overall floral and pollinator richness and beta diversity, as well as varied pollinator diversity and distinct community composition by month. Therefore, judicious design of prairie restoration seed mixes could increase floral diversity and provide across-season forage for pollinators in post-mining landscapes. Our findings also suggest, by the presence of several specialist/uncommon pollinators, that prairie restorations on coal mines can provide habitat for at-risk pollinators.},

	abstract = {Functional Apis mellifera honey bee colonies rely on collaborative brood care typically performed by nurse bees with well-developed hypopharyngeal glands (HPGs). Neonicotinoids, widely used insecticides, have been shown to negatively affect HPG development when worker bees were exposed to field-realistic concentrations either as brood or adults. To date, it is unknown whether timing of neonicotinoid exposure influences the severity of these observed negative effects on HPGs. To address this, we conducted a fully-crossed field experiment assessing potential effects of a neonicotinoid blend (clothianidin and thiamethoxam combined) on worker HPGs when exposed during different life stages. We found that neonicotinoid exposure during the brood stage, but not the adult stage, significantly influenced subsequent HPG development. Since HPG morphogenesis begins during the brood stage, neonicotinoid-induced stress possibly impaired this process, resulting in smaller glands once these individuals became adult nurses. Because HPG productivity is correlated to their size, smaller glands as a result of neonicotinoid exposure could negatively affect colony functionality.},
